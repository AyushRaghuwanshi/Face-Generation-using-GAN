# Face-Generation-using-GAN
- In this project, I uses generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
- It is a Generative Adversarial Network Project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
- It trains a GAN using pytorch on CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) to generate human faces.
